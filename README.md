## PROBLEM EXPLANATION
Using the `match()` method, you can extract parts of a string that match with your regular expression.  In this challenge, you are extracting the vowel's "a, e, i, o, u" from a provided string.

## HINTS
### Hint 1
Are you attempting to use the `test()` method?  Remember this method only returns True or False - we need to extract the vowels from the string.
### Hint 2
Have you tried using the `[]` character case match without commas? i.e. `[abcd]` vs `[a, b, c, d]`.
